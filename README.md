# Yii2/Craft3 memcached enabler

This yii-extension is a memcached drop in replacement for sessions and cache. 

The file `Session` handler and the file `Cache` driver gets replaced in fortrabbit environments where Memcache is enabled - it requires the Memcache component on the Professional Stack.
 


## Install

Require the package:
```
composer require fortrabbit/yii-memcached
```

That's it.
